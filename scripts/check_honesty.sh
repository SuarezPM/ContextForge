# CI honesty guard — fails the build if a hardcoded performance number
# sneaks back into demo/. The V6.0 benchmark shipped with
# `duration_ms=250.0` (and four siblings) hardcoded; V6.1 wired real
# time.perf_counter() calls. This script keeps it that way.
#
# Run: ./scripts/check_honesty.sh
# Exit: 0 if clean, 1 if a regression is detected.
#
# What we forbid:
#   * `duration_ms = <number>`  in demo/*.py — must come from a real
#     time.perf_counter() pair.
#   * `vram_peak_gb = <number>` in demo/*.py — must come from VRAMMonitor.
#   * The Chinese-character rocm-smi flag.
#
# Allowlist:
#   * demo/benchmark.py keeps its per-scenario `vram_peak_gb` floats —
#     they were never claimed to be measured. We only forbid duration_ms
#     in that file.
#   * A `duration_ms=0` sentinel returned on the exception path is not a
#     measurement, and is excluded.
